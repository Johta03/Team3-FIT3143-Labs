MESSAGE PASSING INTERFACE (MPI) III - LAB WEEK 10 SPECIFICATION

CORE TASK - Space Invaders Simulation

===============================================================================
GAME RULES (Section e)
===============================================================================

e.i) PLAYER MOVEMENT:
- Starts at column 0 (leftmost)
- Can move left/right/stay every 1 second
- Cannot move beyond grid boundaries

e.ii) PLAYER FIRING:
- Fires automatically every 1 second (after moving)
- Targets bottom-most surviving invader in current column

e.iii) PLAYER CANNONBALL TRAVEL TIME:
- Bottom row: 2 seconds
- Each additional row: +1 second
- Formula: 2 + (distance from bottom row)
- Example 3-row grid: Row 2=2sec, Row 1=3sec, Row 0=4sec

e.iv) INVADER BEHAVIOR:
- Invaders do NOT move
- Die immediately when hit by player cannonball
- FIRING: Every 4 seconds, check with 10% probability (0.1 uniform chance)
- ONLY bottom-most surviving invader in each column can fire

e.v) INVADER CANNONBALL TRAVEL TIME:
- Same as player: 2 seconds for bottom row + 1 per additional row
- Formula: 2 + (distance from bottom row)

e.vi) WIN/LOSS CONDITIONS:
- Player WINS: All invaders terminated
- Player LOSES: Hit by invader cannonball (dies immediately)
- Game terminates immediately upon either condition

===============================================================================
KEY IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
===============================================================================

1. ARCHITECTURE:
   - 1 MPI process per invader (slaves)
   - 1 MPI process for player (master)
   - 2D Cartesian grid topology for invaders

2. MESSAGE TYPES:
   - MSG_REPORT: Invader status updates
   - MSG_DISABLE: Individual invader death
   - MSG_TERMINATE: Game over (all processes)
   - MSG_CANNONBALL_FROM_PLAYER: Player fires
   - MSG_CANNONBALL_FROM_INVADER: Invader fires

3. TIMING:
   - All processes use master-controlled logical time
   - No sleep() for timing - use tick counter
   - 1 tick = 1 second game time

4. GRID DISPLAY:
   - Show all invader states (A=Active, D=Disabled, X=Terminated)
   - Show player position
   - Show cannonballs in flight with countdown

===============================================================================
EXTENDED TASK (For HD)
===============================================================================

a) CANNONBALL DEFLECTION:
   - 20% chance: deflect left, kill left invader
   - 15% chance: deflect right, kill right invader
   - 20% chance: blocked by shield (no kill)
   - 45% chance: hit target (normal kill)

b) INVADER REBORN:
   - Dead invader can respawn if BOTH left AND right neighbors alive
   - 20% chance every 5 seconds

c) MULTI-PLAYER:
   - Support 2+ players (separate MPI processes)
   - Each has own cannon
   - Prevent cannon overlap/collision
